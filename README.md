# Deal or no deal
Simple project to finally learn how to code, and maybe an already dead project. Console app, using [miniaudio](https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio) library.
The code is heavily inspired by [Cube 2: Sauerbraten](http://sauerbraten.org/): making great things while keeping it simple (tm).

# Maybe in the future:
- Soft-coded text and support for multiple languages.
- Less arithmetic and more sly banker, like in real life!
- Implementing SDL to have a pretty game.
- Add more boxes!
