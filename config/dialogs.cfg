	$%d: It's a good start! Please proceed.
	It's a lucky start! $%d gone.
	Good one! Let's open other boxes.
	You're off to a great start with $%d! Keep it up!
	$%d, that's a promising start! Let's hope it continues.
	Congratulations on a lucky beginning with $%d! What's next?
	That's a nice chunk of change to start with $%d!
	You must be feeling good after deleting $%d right off the bat!
	Keep up the momentum after that successful start with $%d!
[earlyGameMidDialog]
	$%d: We can do better, but it's not that bad.
	We are starting gently: $%d gone.
	Hum... $%d is a little pile of money, but it could be worse.
	You're on the board with $%d: not bad, but there's room for improvement.
[earlyGameLossDialog]
	What a bad start! $%d, in one of the first boxes. Let's try to forget that.
	Are you lucky in your life? Because I have some serious doubts.
	BOOM! $%d gone, and we are only at the beginning!
	That's not the start we were hoping for: $%d already gone.
	You've got your work cut out for you after losing $%d so early on.
	It's not looking good with $%d gone so soon. Can you turn things around?
	That's a tough break: $%d down the drain already.
	$%d gone already? You'll need to be lucky to recover from that.
	Ouch, that's a painful start: $%d gone and many boxes left to open.
[midGameWinDialog] //////////////////////////////////////// Mid game ////////////////////////////////////////
	Nice, only $%d! You're doing well, please choose another box.
	Yay, let the banker cry now! $%d gone.
	Good one! Let's open other boxes.
	Excellent! Just $%d. Keep up the great work!
	Yes! Another low-value box. $%d is no big deal!
	Fantastic news! Only $%d in that box. Keep going!
	Nice one! $%d is a small price to pay for a shot at the big bucks.
	Hooray! That's another low-value box out of the way. $%d won't be missed!
	Great job! $%d is nothing to sneeze at, but it's not what we're here for.
	You're on a roll! Another low-value box down, and $%d with it.
	Awesome! The banker must be fuming now that $%d is off the table.
[midGameMidDialog]
	$%d: We can do better, but it's not that bad.
	$%d: We cannot lose money like that at this state of the game.
	Hum... $%d is a little pile of money, but it could be worse.
	$%d may not be much, but every dollar counts.
	$%d: not great, not terrible.
	A loss of $%d hurts, but we're still in the game and we'll keep pushing.
	Not ideal. $%d is a significant loss, but we'll bounce back.
[midGameLossDialog]
	Holy shit! $%d. Maybe it was the last big one.
	Are you lucky in your life? Because I have some serious doubts.
	BOOM! $%d gone, if the banker call now, we're screwed!
	I bet the banker is now doing a party, and he's right!
	Well folks, we just lost $%d. That's a real kick in the teeth.
	Yikes, that was a tough round. We're down $%d, but we're not out yet!
	That was a brutal loss. $%d down the drain. The banker is surely happy!
	Gah, I hate to see that much money disappear. $%d gone in the blink of an eye.
	Oof, we just took a serious hit. $%d out the door. Can we recover from this?
	Well, that stings. $%d gone in a flash. Let's hope we can turn things around soon.
	Wow, that was a big one. $%d down the tubes. We've got our work cut out for us now.

	Nice, only $%d! You're doing well, please choose another box.

	Good one! Let's open other boxes

	$%d: We can do better, but it's not that bad.
	$%d: We cannot lose money like that at this state of the game.
	Hum... $%d is a little pile of money, but it could be worse.
[endGameLossDialog]
	NO NO NO! Not now, we lost $%d.
	BOOM! $%d gone, if the banker call now, we're screwed!
	I bet the banker is now doing a party, and he's right!
	Nooooo! So close to a win! But that's how it is in Buck or bust!
[bankerCall] //////////////////////////////////////// Bank ////////////////////////////////////////
    It seems that the banker has an offer for you!
    Ah, the banker is calling, I bet he's laughing right now!
    Here comes the sly banker. Watch out! He could bluff us!
	Looks like the banker wants to make a deal. What's it going to be?
	The moment of truth has arrived. The banker is calling with an offer.
	The banker is on the line. Time to see what he's offering us.
	The banker has something to say. Will you take the bucks or keep going?
	The banker is calling with an offer. Do you have what it takes to hold out for more?
[dealRefused]
	It's risky: I like that! Let's continue.
	Maybe we won't see such a good offer again!
	Maybe you've made a good choice and ruined the banker! Let's continue.
	I see that the banker is not generous enough for you!
